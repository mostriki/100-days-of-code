### Day 1: December 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out why current_user was nil when an admin is not logged in. 

**Thoughts** Feels good to close up loose ends on my old Epicodus projects. I hope my teacher is surprised when he sees the resubmission in his inbox one week after class. 


### Day 2: December 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned fundemental computer science and JavaScript lingo. I also played around with Chrome's developer tools more than I ever had before. I look forward to using them to troubleshoot something down the roud. 

**Thoughts** I spent today avoiding my portfolio project and watching @freeCodeCamp videos instead. I don't regret it, but I will have to manage my time better tomorrow.

### Day 3: December 31, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started a Udemy course that has a few lessons I need for my portfolio project. Added code to my .bash_profile to automate making a new directory and changing a directory simultaneously.

**Thoughts** I would like to have more to show for my time, but I learned a lot from watching how a professional developer sets up his project. I also enjoyed the deep dive into the command line interface.
